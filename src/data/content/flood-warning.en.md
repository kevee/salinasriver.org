This website is updated several times a day with data from USGS water guages. If any of these guages cross a defined threshold by NOAA, we automatically place a warning on every page of the site. We use the below water levels to tests if any guage is approaching flood stage.

All of these water levels are a few feet lower than the "Action" stage of the guage. For example, the [yellow water level in the Spreckles gauge](https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=mtr&gage=sprc1).
