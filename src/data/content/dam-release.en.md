Most of the water-related activities on the southern Salinas depend on dam release from the Nacimiento reservoir, and to a lesser extent the San Antonio reservoir. While you can get [real-time flow information from the USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=11150500), if you are planning a trip in the future you should consider dam release sechedule.

The water flows down the Nacimiento and San Antonio Rivers, both of which join up with the Salinas just south of the town of Bradley. When the [river guage at Bradley](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=11150500) is over 400 cfs, the water can sometimes reach beyond King City.
