# 2023 Outlook

With the flood waters receded and the sun shining, we are looking forward to a great summer of floating on the Salinas. The [dam release schedule](/overview/dam-release) for 2023 is now available, and we are excited to see around 600cfs from July through September.

At this flow, it means trips like [Bradley to San Ardo](/trips/bradley-san-ardo) and [San Ardo to San Lucas](/trips/san-ardo-san-lucas) will be runnable all summer long.

We have already scouted or run this stretch of river in April. After the flooding, the river has changed a bit, and has braided several new channels. Make sure to keep an eye on the main flow of water, as there are many backwaters that can leave you stranded.

The [access points](/access-points) in south county are in pretty good shape, with the exception of [San Ardo](/access-points/san-ardo). The Pancho Rico Creek flooded, meaning you have to park further up the road, and carry gear up to a quarter mile to the river through light silt.

We are looking forward to a great summer of floating, and hope to see you on the river!
