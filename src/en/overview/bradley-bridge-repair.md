# Bradley Bridge repair

**Note:** A new path to the river is avaiable at Bradley bridge. Check the [Bradley bridge access point](/access-points/bradley/) for details.

As of June 2022, work has begun on the [Bradley Bridge Scour Repair project](https://ceqanet.opr.ca.gov/2019129031/2). Several pilings of the bridge in the middle of the main river channel were being undercut and their foundations eroded. During construction, the river will be diverted around the project.

The [access path](/access-points/bradley/) to the bridge will not be affected after construction, according to the project plans.
