# Bradley Bridge repair

There is currently **no access** to the river from the Bradley bridge through the summer of 2023.

As of June 2022, work has begun on the [Bradley Bridge Scour Repair project](https://ceqanet.opr.ca.gov/2019129031/2). Several pilings of the bridge in the middle of the main river channel were being undercut and their foundations eroded. During construction, the river will be diverted around the project.

The [access path](/access-points/bradley/) to the bridge will not be affected after construction, according to the project plans.
