# Nacimiento and San Antonio release schedule

Most of the water-related activities on the southern Salinas depend on dam release from the Nacimiento reservoir, and to a lesser extent the San Antonio reservoir. While you can get [real-time flow information from the USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=11150500), if you are planning a trip in the future you should consider the following dam release sechedule.

<small>From the [Monterey County Water Resources Agency 2024 release schedule](https://www.countyofmonterey.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/121560). CFS is defined as "Mean daily flow for the month."</small>

The water flows down the Nacimiento and San Antonio Rivers, both of which join up with the Salinas just south of the town of Bradley. When the [river guage at Bradley](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=11150500) is over 400 cfs (it is currently {{guages.bradley.cfs}}), the water can sometimes reach beyond King City.
