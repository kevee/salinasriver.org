# Nacimiento and San Antonio release schedule

Most of the water-related activities on the southern Salinas depend on dam release from the Nacimiento reservoir, and to a lesser extent the San Antonio reservoir. While you can get [real-time flow information from the USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=11150500), if you are planning a trip in the future you should consider the following dam release sechedule.

This was the **release schedule for 2025**. We expect a provisoinal release schedule to be released around March 2026.

<small>From the [Monterey County Water Resources Agency 2025 provisional release schedule](https://monterey.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?M=F&ID=fea9a761-9345-495c-8476-050c65fe7e81.pdf). CFS is defined as "Mean daily flow for the month."</small>

The water flows down the Nacimiento and San Antonio Rivers, both of which join up with the Salinas just south of the town of Bradley. When the [river guage at Bradley](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=11150500) is over 400 cfs (it is currently {{guages.bradley.cfs}}), the water can sometimes reach beyond King City.
