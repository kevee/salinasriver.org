alert: There is a new gate block ing this access point. You can possibly get to the river by parking on the western side of the San Ardo bridge over the river, and dropping down to the right as you face the bridge. There is a small fence with an opening. We will update this page when we have more information.
directions: Park at the end of Jolon Road, where there is an open gate built into a tall wildlife fence. Pass throught the fence and turn left, following the trail to the dry wash of Rancho Rico Creek. Turn right and follow the wash and the old bridge footings to the river, around 300 yards. There is a large beach along the river.
webcamNote: The webcam is located just south of the San Ardo oil fields, pointing south.

Locals like to hang out on the beach of Rancho Rico Creek and wade up the river to swim in deep pools.

**Note**: As of the 2023 floods, the parking area is further up the road. While this is still a great put-in, it will take a while to carry any boats or heavy gear to the river from this put-in.
