  Park at the overflow parking for the Creekside Terrace entrance of the Fort Ord National Monument. Follow a use trail down to Toro Creek, which is almost always dry. There is some Poison Oak. Once in Toro Creek, turn left (north) towards the Salinas River 1/4 a mile. This entrance is on BLM land.

A better access point than trying to enter via the Highway 68 overpass. Plenty of parking, and access via public land.
