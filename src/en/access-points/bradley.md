A beautiful stretch of the river surrounded by shaded cottonwood trees. Many locals will access the river under the bridge then wade upstream to the old bridge footing for some deep swimming holes.

This access point does not involve trespassing. Landowners have built styles into fencing to allow the public to pass.
