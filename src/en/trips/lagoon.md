Most of the year except for the wettest months between December and March, the Salinas River doesn't flow to the ocean. Instead, it forms a large lagoon that is part of the Salinas River Wildlife Refuge. The lagoon is about a mile long from the ocean to the beginning of the refuge boundary. You can also continue up river to make a longer loop.

Note that if there is any significant flow, then the [river mouth could be breached](/overview/safety#breach) and you should not attempt going down river.

During the fall and winter the refuge is open for duck hunting, making floating on the lagoon less fun.
