One of the most consistently-runnable sections of the river in the summer when a large lagoon backs up to Blanco.

Note that if there is any significant flow, then the [river mouth could be breached](/overview/safety#breach) and you should not attempt going down river.

This trip can be run either north-to-south or south-to-north as the river backs up into a lagoon on this stretch. It's best to check out the river first at Blanco. If there is no flow, then going from the north-to-south is a better option because the prevailing winds will be at your back.

There is a [rubber dam](/overview/rubber-dam) five miles from the river mouth that could require a portage if it is up.

When there is no flow, large expanses of duckweed can clog the waterway, making paddling extremely slow above the dam.
