  There are several barbed-wire fences that cross the river. The flow is never very high, so it is easy to spot these and make your way to the river's edge. There are several narrow sections that at higher flows have moderate strainers. Stay close to the main flow in these areas.

      Exit the river on the right at a large sand bar next to the footings of the old bridge before the current Sand Ardo bridge. Follow the dry wash to the right, away from the river. Turn left when you hit a fence, and follow the fence to an opening built into it.
