  <p>
    Suggested iteneraries for floating the Salinas. Because there
    <strong>is no whitewater</strong> on the river, you can use a variety of
    craft for these trips, but read descriptions carefully for other hazards
    like strainers, which require at least a little boating skill to navigate.
