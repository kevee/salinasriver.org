# The Salinas River

## A recreation guide

**This is a guide for enjoying the Salinas River**. It
flows for 170 miles south to north in Central California. It is home to beavers and bald
eagles. Neighbors noodle on its banks for catfish, and cool off in
its silty waters in the summer.

When [conditions are right](/overview), you can float down long sections of the Salinas. This guide outlines common [places to access the river](/access-points) and [suggested trips](/trips).
