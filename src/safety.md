# Safety

Enjoying the Salinas River at public access points is both safe and fun,
but certain activities carry more risk than others.

<a id="water"></a>**Water** —The Salinas contains agricultural runoff that
is difficult to completely filter with a standard backpacking filter.
The water is also very silty. Bring enough drinking water for your
entire trip.

<a id="tresspass"></a>**Tresspass** — Use your best judgement to determine if
you are tresspassing. Many established access areas are on private land
which the owner has graciously opened for the public.
