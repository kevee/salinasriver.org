# Bradley Bridge repair

As of June 2022, work has begun on the [Bradley Bridge Scour Repair project](https://ceqanet.opr.ca.gov/2019129031/2). Several pilings of the bridge in the middle of the main river channel were being undercut and their foundations eroded. During construction, the river will be diverted around the project.

During construction, you may have no access to the river. We expect the project to be wrapped up by Fall 2022.

The [access path](/access-points/bradley/) to the bridge will not be affected after construction, according to the project plans.
