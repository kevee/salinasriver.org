# The Salinas River

## A recreation guide

**This is a guide for enjoying the Salinas River**. It
flows for 170 miles south to north. It is home to beavers and bald
eagles. Residents noodle on its banks for catfish, and cool off in
its silty waters in the summer.

When conditions are right, you can float down long sections of the Salinas. This guide outlines common [places to access the river](/access-points) and [suggested trips](/trips).
