# The Salinas River diversion facility

**AKA "The Rubber Dam"**

The rubber dam is located approximately 5 miles up river (south) of the Salinas river mouth. It was built to provide irrigation water and prevent saltwater intrusion. When the dam is raised during the dry months, it creates a pond up river.

The dam can be easily portaged on river right. It has a safety bouy up stream, and the water above it is usually either slack or moves slowly.
