Many established access areas are on private land
which the owner has graciously opened for the public. All of the access points
listed here are either public, or have clear, well-established trails that have
been used for years.

I grew up along the river, and been in the river hundreds of times. Residents of south Monterey county are often found wading, swimming, or fishing in the river.

While there are some questions about whether you are allowed to be on the river, [American Whitewater's excellent Navigability Primer](https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Wiki/stewardship:navigability) says:

> In the California court case of People v. Mack, the ruling stated, “The public has the right to navigate below the high water mark on rivers which are capable of being navigated by small recreational craft.” In other words, the definition of navigability in California rests on whether the river is capable of floating a canoe or kayak. American Whitewater strongly advocates this test of navigability.
