# Tresspassing

**Dislcaimer** this website should not be construed as, and it does not constitute, legal advice on any specific matter.

Many established access areas are on private land
which the owner has graciously opened for the public. All of the access points
listed here are either public, or have clear, well-established trails that have
been used for years.

While there is confusion about whether you are allowed to actually float on the river, [American Whitewater's excellent Navigability Primer](https://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Wiki/stewardship:navigability) says:

> In the California court case of People v. Mack, the ruling stated, “The public has the right to navigate below the high water mark on rivers which are capable of being navigated by small recreational craft.” In other words, the definition of navigability in California rests on whether the river is capable of floating a canoe or kayak. American Whitewater strongly advocates this test of navigability.

In addition, the river is listed as navigable in [state Harbors and Navigation Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=HNC&sectionNum=105.), although People v. Mack states:

> The Legislature's failure to include a water course within its listing of waterways did not and cannot cede such waterways into private ownership.

The land surrounding the river is definitely private. Protect your access to the river by:

- Staying only on the shores of main river channels
- Only use [defined access points](/access-points) to enter and exit the river
- Never cross over a fence to enter/access the river. There are some fences which cross the river. These are used to define grazing areas for cattle. Pass below or above these safely without damaging the fence.
- Leave no trace
