# Safety

Enjoying the Salinas River at public access points is both safe and fun,
but certain activities carry more risk than others.

<h2 id="water">Water</h2>

The Salinas contains agricultural runoff that
is difficult to completely filter with a standard backpacking filter.
The water is also very silty. Bring enough drinking water for your
entire trip.

Several sections of the river are surrounded by ranch land. Cows can graze the
banks and the main channel of the river. If your dog would chase a cow, make sure
to keep it under your control.
