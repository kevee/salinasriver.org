# The Salinas River diversion facility

**AKA "The Rubber Dam"**

The rubber dam is located approximately 5 miles up river (south) of the Salinas river mouth. It was built to provide irrigation water and prevent saltwater intrusion. When the dam is raised during the dry months, it creates a pond up river. The planned operation of the dam is:

- **November 1 to March 31** — Lowered (water is flowing freely)
- **April 1 to May 31** — Raised. Water typically flows over the gates during this time.
- **June 1 to October 31** — Raised. The lagood is full, and no more water flows over the dam.

The dam can be easily portaged on river right. It has a safety bouy up stream, and the water above it is usually either slack or moves slowly.
