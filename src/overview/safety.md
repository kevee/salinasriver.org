# Safety

Enjoying the Salinas River at public access points is both safe and fun,
but certain activities carry more risk than others. Make sure to also be aware
of your [rights and responsibilities involving tresspassing](/overview/tresspass).

Whatever your activity, make sure to

<h2 id="water">Water</h2>

The Salinas can contain agricultural runoff that
is difficult to completely filter with a standard backpacking filter.
The water is also very silty. Bring enough drinking water for your
entire trip.

<h2 id="dogs">Dogs</h2>

Several sections of the river are surrounded by ranch land. Cows can graze the
banks and the main channel of the river. If your dog would chase a cow, make sure
to keep it under your control.

<h2 id="strainers">Strainers</h2>

The most common form of danger on the river is low trees and brush that are found
along the banks. Make sure you know how to safely prevent or exit a strainer situation.
