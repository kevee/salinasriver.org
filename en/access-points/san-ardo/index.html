Pass throught the fence and turn left, following the trail to the dry wash of Rancho Rico Creek. Turn right and follow the wash and the old bridge footings to the river, around 300 yards. There is a large beach along the river.</p><div class="map short"><div id="map"></div></div><script>window._accessPointPath = {"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiLineString","coordinates":[[[-120.91243,36.01493,127],[-120.91238,36.01493,127],[-120.91233,36.01498,127],[-120.91229,36.015,127],[-120.91225,36.01501,127],[-120.91221,36.01502,127],[-120.91219,36.01504,127],[-120.91216,36.01508,127],[-120.91213,36.0151,127],[-120.91209,36.01513,126],[-120.91206,36.01515,126],[-120.91201,36.01517,126],[-120.91197,36.01519,126],[-120.91193,36.01521,126],[-120.9119,36.01523,126],[-120.91187,36.01525,126],[-120.91184,36.01527,126],[-120.91182,36.0153,126],[-120.9118,36.01532,126],[-120.91177,36.01535,126],[-120.91174,36.01536,126],[-120.91171,36.01539,126],[-120.91169,36.01541,126],[-120.91165,36.01543,126],[-120.91162,36.01544,126],[-120.91158,36.01545,126],[-120.91154,36.01546,126],[-120.9115,36.01547,126],[-120.91147,36.01547,126],[-120.91143,36.01547,126],[-120.91138,36.01547,126],[-120.91135,36.01548,126],[-120.91131,36.01549,126],[-120.91127,36.01551,126],[-120.91124,36.01552,126],[-120.9112,36.01554,126],[-120.91116,36.01555,126],[-120.91113,36.01556,126],[-120.91108,36.01557,126],[-120.91104,36.01558,126],[-120.91099,36.01559,126],[-120.91095,36.01559,126],[-120.91091,36.0156,126],[-120.91088,36.01561,126],[-120.91083,36.01562,126],[-120.91079,36.01562,126],[-120.91075,36.01563,126],[-120.9107,36.01563,126],[-120.91065,36.01563,126],[-120.91061,36.01563,126],[-120.91058,36.01565,126],[-120.91054,36.01566,126],[-120.91049,36.01566,126],[-120.91045,36.01567,126],[-120.9104,36.01567,126],[-120.91036,36.01567,126],[-120.91032,36.01568,126],[-120.91028,36.01569,126],[-120.91024,36.0157,127],[-120.91019,36.0157,127],[-120.91015,36.01571,127],[-120.9101,36.01572,127],[-120.91007,36.01574,127],[-120.91002,36.01575,127],[-120.90999,36.01576,128],[-120.90995,36.01578,128],[-120.90991,36.01579,128],[-120.90987,36.01581,128],[-120.90984,36.01582,128],[-120.90979,36.01583,128],[-120.90974,36.01584,128],[-120.9097,36.01584,129],[-120.90966,36.01585,129],[-120.90962,36.01586,129],[-120.90958,36.01588,129],[-120.90955,36.01589,129],[-120.90951,36.01591,129],[-120.90947,36.01591,129],[-120.90944,36.01593,129],[-120.90942,36.01595,129],[-120.90942,36.01598,129],[-120.90943,36.01601,129],[-120.90943,36.01604,129],[-120.90944,36.01607,129],[-120.90944,36.01611,129],[-120.90944,36.01614,129],[-120.90945,36.01618,129],[-120.90946,36.01622,129],[-120.90947,36.01625,129],[-120.90948,36.01628,129],[-120.90948,36.01632,129],[-120.90948,36.01636,129],[-120.90948,36.01638,129],[-120.90949,36.01641,130],[-120.90951,36.01644,130],[-120.90951,36.01648,130],[-120.90952,36.01651,130],[-120.90951,36.01654,130],[-120.90948,36.01653,130],[-120.90943,36.01652,129],[-120.90939,36.01653,129],[-120.90935,36.01654,129],[-120.9093,36.01654,129],[-120.90927,36.01655,129],[-120.90922,36.01655,129],[-120.90919,36.01655,129],[-120.90915,36.01657,129],[-120.90912,36.01659,129],[-120.90909,36.01662,129],[-120.90908,36.01665,129],[-120.90906,36.01668,129]]],"bbox":[-120.90906,36.01668,-120.91243,36.01493]}}]}
