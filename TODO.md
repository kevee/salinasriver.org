Missing Content on Shared Pages
This is the bigger finding — nearly all body content has been stripped from every page that exists in both branches:

Access Point Pages (all 14, both languages)
Every access point page is missing:

Description paragraphs (e.g. Bradley's "A beautiful stretch of the river surrounded by shaded cottonwood trees...")
Best flow data
Water level (live gauge data)
Driving directions (Google Maps links)
Parking directions
Webcam references (Bradley, San Ardo)
Private property warnings (Bradley South, San Ardo)
Alert paragraphs (San Ardo gate warning, Camp Roberts warning)
Trip Pages (all 5, both languages)
Every trip page is missing:

Length, Time, Access Points, Best flow, Current flow, Gear metadata
Full trip descriptions (multiple paragraphs of narrative)
Waypoint-by-waypoint guides (distance markers with instructions)
Private property and Afternoon wind warnings
Spanish pages: "Descripcion" header was renamed to "Configuracion"
Spanish trips index: missing h1 "Recorridos" entirely
Overview Pages (all 6, both languages)
All body text missing:

Dam release: Monthly CFS schedule table gone
Flood message: Gauge threshold table gone
Overview index: River description + link descriptions gone
Private property: Legal discussion (People v. Mack) gone
Rubber dam: Seasonal schedule + portage instructions gone
Safety: All 6 safety topic paragraphs gone
Legal Pages (both languages)
Legal index: All 6 disclaimer paragraphs gone
Accessibility: Full accessibility statement gone
Homepage (both languages)
Access point list, trip list, newsletter/bumper sticker links, webcam image all missing
Bug: h1/h2 concatenated — "The Salinas RiverA recreation guide" (missing space)
Bumper Sticker Pages
Body text ("We'll mail you a free bumper sticker...") missing
Key Issues to Address
URL typo: es/overview/pivate-property/ should be private-property
Homepage h1 bug: "The Salinas RiverA recreation guide" — missing separator
Missing body content everywhere: This appears to be the main gap — pages have headers/structure but all descriptive text, data tables, and instructions are gone
Missing pages: news, newsletter, 404, sitemap
Missing root-level redirects: Old bookmarks to /access-points/, /trips/, etc. will break
Spanish trips: "Descripcion" was renamed to "Configuracion" — likely a translation key issue
