It was built to provide irrigation water and prevent saltwater intrusion. When the dam is raised during the dry months, it creates a pond up river. The planned operation of the dam is:</p><ul><li><strong>November 1 to March 31</strong> — Lowered (water is flowing freely)</li><li><strong>April 1 to May 31</strong> — Raised. Water typically flows over the gates during this time.</li><li><strong>June 1 to October31</strong> — Raised. The lagood is full, and no more water flows over the dam.</li></ul><p>The dam can be easily portaged on river right. It has a safety bouy up stream, and the water above it is usually either slack or moves slowly.</p></section></div><footer><div class="container">By <a href="https://kevee.net">Kevin Miller</a>.
